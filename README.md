# digital_clock_using_JavaScript
I have completed my first mini project of digital clock using JavaScript.
i am done this project by using document.getElementById method in which time is shown in digital format.The approach is to use the date object to get time on every second and then re-rendering time on the browser using the new time that we got by calling the same function each second.
